The two important base traits in this library are
[[com.rayrobdod.json.builder.Builder]] and [[com.rayrobdod.json.parser.Parser]].
To convert a thing into another thing - for example to deserialize a json format
string into a model object - one implementation of each trait is obtained (which
implementation depends on the input and output), the input and builder implementation
are fed into the [[com.rayrobdod.json.parser.Parser#parse Parser's parse method]] and
that method returns the resulting object (or an error).

[[com.rayrobdod.json.parser]] contains the Parser top-level trait and several implementations of Parser.

[[com.rayrobdod.json.builder]] contains the Builder top-level trait and several implementations of Builder

[[com.rayrobdod.json.union]] contains 'glue' classes - mostly unions required to typecheck parsers and builder's primitive values.

------

For deserialization, one would pick a parser from this library
([[com.rayrobdod.json.parser.JsonParser]] for json,
[[com.rayrobdod.json.parser.CborParser]] for cbor, etc) and either a custom
Builder implementation or an instance of
[[com.rayrobdod.json.builder.PiecewiseBuilder]]

For serialization, one would use a custom Parser and a builder from this library
([[com.rayrobdod.json.builder.PrettyJsonBuilder]] for json,
[[com.rayrobdod.json.builder.CborBuilder]] for cbor, etc.)
