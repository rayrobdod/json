There are two types of classes in this library. The first is
[[com.rayrobdod.json.builder.Builder]],
which has to be implemented by a user of the library. The purpose is to receive
values from the parser and add it to data objects. 

The other type of class is the [[com.rayrobdod.json.parser]].
Each parser accepts one file format. They universally take a Builder as a constructor
parameter and contain a single method: 'parse' which takes either a DataInput or
a Iterable[Char] and returning an object.
