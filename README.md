## Build Instructions
This repository uses [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) as its build tool.

The dependencies can be found by sbt automatically, but only scala itself isn't
used just for testing.

## Usage
There are two types of classes in this library. The first is
[Builder](src/main/scala/com/rayrobdod/json/builder/Builder.scala),
which has to be implemented by a user of the library. The purpose is to receive
values from the parser and add it to data objects. 

The other type of class is the [parsers](src/main/scala/com/rayrobdod/json/parser).
Each parser accepts one file format. They universally take a Builder as a constructor
parameter and contain a single method: 'parse' which takes either a DataInput or
a Iterable[Char] and returning an object.


An example use is indicated in [/doc/exampleUsage.scala](doc/exampleUsage.scala).
